    <textblock>
      Phase 1, single -center study in 2 parts. The study designs for each part are well&#xD;
      established for first-in-human studies and are appropriate to assess safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary pharmacokinetics&amp; pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, single centre, phase 1 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight healthy males or females, aged between 18-55 years old, who meet all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of 2 groups to be enrolled sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Group 1a (sentinel group): two participants will be randomised single-blinded such that one&#xD;
      participant will receive AL+Rux and the other participant will receive AL+placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of the safety and tolerability data up to and including Day 8 from Group 1a by&#xD;
      the Safety Review Committee (SRC), a decision to proceed with Group 1b will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Group 1b will be composed of 6 participants, to be randomised single-blinded such that five&#xD;
      participants will receive AL+Rux, and one participant will receive AL+placebo.&#xD;
