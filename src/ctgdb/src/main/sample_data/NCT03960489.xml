      The purpose of the study is to assess the relative bioavailability of single doses of 100 mg&#xD;
      roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free tablet and 100 mg roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free&#xD;
      mini-tablet solid and suspension (new formulations) compared to 100 mg roxadustat azo&#xD;
      dye-containing tablet (reference formulation) under fasting conditions in healthy male and&#xD;
      female adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of 100 mg&#xD;
      roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free tablet and 100 mg roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free&#xD;
      mini-tablet solid and suspension (new formulations) and a single dose of 100 mg roxadustat&#xD;
      azo dye-containing tablet (reference formulation) under fasting conditions in healthy male&#xD;
      and female adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-period, 4-sequence single dose crossover study. Each participant will participate&#xD;
      in 4 treatment periods separated by a washout of at least 7 days between study drug&#xD;
      administrations in each period. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for up to 21 days prior to study drug administration on day 1&#xD;
      of period 1. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 of each&#xD;
      period and will be residential for 5 days/4 nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of 100 mg roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free tablet,&#xD;
      100 mg roxadustat pediatric azo dye-free mini-tablet (suspension), 100 mg roxadustat&#xD;
      pediatric azo dye-free mini-tablet (solid) (new formulations) or 100 mg roxadustat azo&#xD;
      dye-containing tablet (reference formulation) under fasting conditions on day 1 of each&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
