      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat&#xD;
      compared with active control (epoetin alfa) for the maintenance treatment of anemia in&#xD;
      participants with ESRD on dialysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will consist of three study periods as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Period of up to 6 weeks (8 weeks if on Mircera)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Period: a minimum of 52 weeks, a maximum of up to 3 years from the date last&#xD;
           participant is randomized. Minimum study duration for participants enrolled under&#xD;
           Protocol Amendment 1 or 2 may be less than 52 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Follow-up period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa&#xD;
      (active control) in an open-label manner.&#xD;

Rescue therapy for roxadustat treated participants was defined as recombinant erythropoietin or analogue (ESA) or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and rescue therapy for epoetin alfa treated participants was defined as RBC transfusion. Baseline Hb was defined the mean of up to 4 last central lab values prior to the first dose of study treatment. The intermittent missing Hb data was imputed for each treatment relying on non-missing data from all participants within each treatment group using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) imputation model, Monotone missing data were imputed by regression from its own treatment group.</description>

The physical functioning subscore and vitality subscore are reported. Each scale was transformed into 0-100 score, with higher scores indicating better health status.

    <description>Participants will receive roxadustat tablets, administered orally 3 times weekly (TIW). Initial roxadustat dose will be based on the participant's average prescribed erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) dose in the 4 weeks (if on epoetin or darbepoetin or 8 weeks (if on Mircera®) prior to randomization. Dose adjustments will be permitted to maintain a hemoglobin (Hb) level of approximately 11 grams (g)/deciliter (dL). The maximum roxadustat dose is 3.0 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) per dose or 400 mg per administration (whichever is lower).</description>

    <description>Participants on hemodialysis (HD) will receive epoetin alfa, administered intravenously (IV) TIW and participants on home HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) will receive epoetin alfa, administered subcutaneously (SC). Initial epoetin alfa dose will be based on the participant's average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if on Mircera®. In case of a change in route of administration from SC to IV (TIW), the initial dose of IV epoetin alfa will be determined by the investigator per local standard of care (SOC). Dose adjustments will follow the recommendations as per the approved country-specific product label (United States Package Insert [USPI] or Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]) or local SOC.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Roxadustat</title>
          <description>Participants received roxadustat tablets, administered orally 3 times weekly (TIW). Initial roxadustat dose was based on the participant's average prescribed erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) dose in the 4 weeks (if on epoetin or darbepoetin or 8 weeks (if on Mircera®) prior to randomization. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain a hemoglobin (Hb) level of approximately 11 grams (g)/deciliter (dL). The maximum roxadustat dose was 3.0 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) per dose or 400 mg per administration (whichever was lower). The maximum treatment duration was 183.7 weeks.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Epoetin Alfa</title>
          <description>Participants on hemodialysis (HD) received epoetin alfa, administered intravenously (IV) TIW and participants on home HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) received epoetin alfa, administered subcutaneously (SC). Initial epoetin alfa dose was based on the participant's average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if on Mircera®. In case of a change in route of administration from SC to IV (TIW), the initial dose of IV epoetin alfa was determined by the investigator per local standard of care (SOC). Dose adjustments followed the recommendations as per the approved country-specific product label (United States Package Insert [USPI] or Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]) or local SOC. The maximum treatment duration was 180.4 weeks.</description>

        <title>US (FDA) Submission: Mean Hb Change From Baseline to The Average Level During The Evaluation Period (Weeks 28 to 52), Regardless of Rescue Therapy</title>
        <description>Hb values under the influence of rescue therapy were not censored in the analysis. Rescue therapy for roxadustat treated participants was defined as recombinant erythropoietin or analogue (ESA) or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and rescue therapy for epoetin alfa treated participants was defined as RBC transfusion. Baseline Hb was defined the mean of up to 4 last central lab values prior to the first dose of study treatment. The intermittent missing Hb data was imputed for each treatment relying on non-missing data from all participants within each treatment group using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) imputation model, Monotone missing data were imputed by regression from its own treatment group.</description>

Initial epoetin alfa dose was based on the participant's average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if on Mircera®. In case of a change in route of administration from SC to IV (TIW), the initial dose of IV epoetin alfa was determined by the investigator per local SOC. Dose adjustments followed the recommendations as per the approved country-specific product label (USPI or SmPC) or local SOC. The maximum treatment duration was 180.4 weeks.</description>

          <population>FAS Population included all randomized/enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had baseline and at least 1 postdose Hb assessment. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure and 'Number Analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified timepoint.</population>

          <description>Participants received roxadustat tablets, administered orally TIW. Initial roxadustat dose was based on the participant's average prescribed ESA dose in the 4 weeks (if on epoetin or darbepoetin or 8 weeks (if on Mircera®) prior to randomization. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain a Hb level of approximately 11 g/dL. The maximum roxadustat dose was 3.0 mg/kg per dose or 400 mg per administration (whichever was lower).

          <description>Participants on HD received epoetin alfa, administered IV TIW and participants on home HD or PD received epoetin alfa, administered SC. Initial epoetin alfa dose was based on the participant's average weekly prescribed ESA dose in 4 weeks prior to randomization if on epoetin or darbepoetin, and average monthly (4-week) prescribed ESA dose in 8 weeks prior to randomization if on Mircera®. In case of a change in route of administration from SC to IV (TIW), the initial dose of IV epoetin alfa was determined by the investigator per local SOC. Dose adjustments followed the recommendations as per the approved country-specific product label (USPI or SmPC) or local SOC. The maximum treatment duration was 180.4 weeks.</description>
