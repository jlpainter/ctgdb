  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study for participants of the randomized placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel-group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal NMS-Nab Study,&#xD;
      assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of nabilone for non-motor symptoms in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson´s Disease (PD). Nabilone is an analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the&#xD;
      psychoactive component of cannabis. Nabilone acts as a partial agonist on both Cannabinoid 1&#xD;
      (CB1) and Cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor in humans and therefore mimics the effect of THC but&#xD;
      with more predictable side effects and less euphoria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be re-tapered in an open-label nabilone dose optimization phase&#xD;
      followed by an open-label period of 6 months on a stable nabilone dose.&#xD;

      This is an open-label extension study for participants of the randomized placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel-group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal NMS-Nab Study,&#xD;
      assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of nabilone for non-motor symptoms in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson´s Disease. Nabilone is an analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the&#xD;
      psychoactive component of cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be re-tapered with open-label nabilone, optimally up to the dose the&#xD;
      patient had in the NMS-Nab Trial. It is the investigator´s decision to modify this dose, if&#xD;
      necessary. The re-tapering will be performed up to a maximum dose of 1 mg twice daily.&#xD;
      Treatment responders will enter the open-label treatment period for 6 months with visits&#xD;
      being performed every 3 months in the context of the patient´s regularly scheduled visits in&#xD;
      the specialized outpatient department. The last visit will be the Termination Visit.&#xD;
      Following this, nabilone will be tapered. During this period the patients will receive phone&#xD;
      calls every other day. A Safety Follow-Up Visit will be performed.&#xD;

        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In order to be eligible for the study, patients must have completed the double-blind&#xD;
             phase of the NMS-Nab trial as responders within the last 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For patients that completed NMS-Nab Study over 2 months prior to the Screening /&#xD;
             Baseline Visit, and meet all other inclusion criteria, eligibility should be discussed&#xD;
             on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Only patients without a drug-related serious adverse event (SAE) or (drug-related)&#xD;
             moderate or severe AE during the NMS-Nab Study can be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any&#xD;
             study related procedure being performed. Patients with a legal guardian should be&#xD;
             consented according to local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be willing and able to take oral medication and able to comply with the&#xD;
             study specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient is in good health as determined by medical examination and based on the&#xD;
             investigator's judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following characteristics will be excluded from entering the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with PArkinson´s Disease (PD) who have not participated in the randomized&#xD;
             double-blind phase of the previous NMS-Nab Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients that experienced a drug-related SAE or had a (drug-related) moderate or&#xD;
             severe AE during the NMS-Nab Study will be excluded in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the study procedures in the&#xD;
             investigator´s opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with any clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition at&#xD;
             the Screening / Baseline Visit that may preclude safety and the completion of the&#xD;
             study participation (based on the investigator's judgement).&#xD;
